        <p class="text-light">
          This story showcases Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam's honesty and strong principles. Despite being offered a complimentary grinder as a gesture of goodwill, Dr. Kalam declined to accept it without paying. This reflects his belief in fairness and integrity. Later, he took the effort to send the company the exact price of the grinder from his own personal account. This act highlights his commitment to ethical behavior and his insistence on paying for what he receives, regardless of his status or the intentions behind the gift.

        <h5 class="text-cyan">Lunch with Children</h5>
        <p class="text-light">
          Dr. Kalam's compassion and empathy are illustrated in this story. During a visit to a school, instead of accepting a lavish lunch prepared by the principal, he chose to share a simple meal with the students, sitting on the floor alongside them. This gesture demonstrated his humility and his ability to connect with young people on their level. It showed that he valued simplicity and the importance of making everyone feel included and respected, regardless of their background or social status.

        <p class="text-light">
          This story highlights Dr. Kalam's ability to remain calm and composed under pressure, a crucial trait for a leader in aerospace and defense. During a critical launch, there was a leak that could have jeopardized the mission. Demonstrating resourcefulness and quick thinking, Dr. Kalam used a rolled-up newspaper to fix the leak temporarily, allowing the team to successfully reschedule the launch. This incident not only underscores his problem-solving skills and calm demeanor but also his determination to find solutions in the face of unexpected challenges.
